Haiti does not manufacture firearms or bullets, with other guns wielded by the groups stolen from the Haitian military and&nbsp;police.</p><p>In the first half of 2022, officials at Haina Occidental Port seized more than 112,000 “units of firearms and ammunition”, with much of it shipped from Miami, according to a <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/toc/Haiti_assessment_UNODC.pdf" target="_blank">UN&nbsp;report</a>.</p><p>Analysis of data from trade platform CargoFax reveals that between July 2020 and March 2023, 34 shipments were sent from US ports to Haitian individuals now on the US sanctions&nbsp;list.</p><p>It included 24 shipments for Prophane Victor, a former member of parliament who has long been accused by the UN and US of arming gangs. The goods he received were described as personal effects — thrift store items and used&nbsp;shoes.</p><p>Easy access to American weapons increases violence across the whole region, says Evan Ellis, professor of Latin American studies at the US Army War College. An October report by the US firearms enforcement agency says that 73 per cent of guns recovered in crimes in the Caribbean between 2018-22 were from the US, mainly Florida, Georgia and Texas. Ellis adds that Haiti’s gangs also acquire body armour and other combat equipment from&nbsp;China.</p><h2 class="body-text__header">The Miami River</h2><p>Miami has become the main hub for smuggling weapons to Haiti for a number of reasons: it has a large diaspora swelled by refugees; there is a loosely regulated export industry which sends small shipments to the country; and Florida’s lenient gun&nbsp;laws.</p><p>Florida does not require a permit to purchase firearms and there is no limit on the number that can be bought in a single transaction. In 2023, Florida scrapped the mandatory training, licensing fees and background checks required to carry a concealed weapon. There are also few restrictions on buying ammunition.</p><p>“It's a huge issue,” says Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, a congresswoman representing South Florida in the House of Representatives and the only sitting Haitian-American lawmaker. “Maybe 80 to 85 per cent of the guns in Haiti come from the US — and they’re directly coming from the Miami River.” She adds that with Florida regulations making it even easier to buy guns, anybody “in cahoots” with the gangs is able to purchase weapons and send them to&nbsp;Haiti.</p><p>“Lax US gun laws allow gangs to source military grade weaponry almost freely,” says Louis-Henri Mars, executive director of Lakou Lapè, a Port-au-Prince-based peace-building organisation.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="ig-body-els__wide"><div class="vs-side-by-side-images"><figure class="vs-side-by-side-images__figure vs-side-by-side-images__figure--full-width"><div class="o-grid-container"><div class="o-grid-row"><div data-o-grid-colspan="12"><div class="vs-side-by-side-images__image-wrapper vs-side-by-side-images__image-wrapper--2"><picture><img class="vs-image" srcSet="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fseized-firearms.1.Dfw9oY_d.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fseized-firearms.1.Dfw9oY_d.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=800 800w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fseized-firearms.1.Dfw9oY_d.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=1400 1400w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fseized-firearms.1.Dfw9oY_d.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=2000 2000w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fseized-firearms.1.Dfw9oY_d.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=2600 2600w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fseized-firearms.1.Dfw9oY_d.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=3200 3200w" src="https://ig.ft.com/haiti-gangs/assets/static/seized-firearms.1.Dfw9oY_d.jpg" alt="A collection of firearms displayed on a table, including rifles and machine guns, surrounds a Homeland Security Investigations emblem.

sealed.

He adds that US Customs and Border Protection agents checked less than 5 per cent of exports when he left DHS three years ago. In the majority of cases, paperwork isn’t required for exports valued at $2,500 or less, further reducing oversight.</p><p>From the freight forwarders, the cargo is transferred to carriers who transport the goods to Haiti. Three miles from Eugenio Trading’s warehouse, on the Miami River, is Antillean Marine, the largest shipping carrier for cargo travelling between Miami and Haiti and the group that operates the Sara Regina. The company declined to speak to the FT about the cache of guns on the&nbsp;vessel.</p><p>The danger posed by gangs at Haiti’s ports means shipments to the country increasingly arrive via the Dominican Republic, with goods then driven across the&nbsp;border.</p><p>The weapons seized on the Sara Regina were meant to take this route. Shipping records show they were to be received in Haina Occidental Port by a man based in the Dominican border town of Elias Pina, before being transported to the Haitian town of Belladere.</p><p>The 400 Mawozo gang are active in the area and control the road that connects Belladere to Port-au-Prince, making the gang or one of its allies the potential recipients.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="ig-body-els__wide"><div class="vs-inline-wrapper"><figure class="vs-inline-wrapper__figure ig-comp ig-comp--antillean ig-comp--fullgrid"><div class="o-grid-container"><div class="o-grid-row"><div data-o-grid-colspan="12"><div class="grid"><div class="cell"><picture><img class="vs-image" srcSet="https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fantillean.Cf2TAlo3.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=200 200w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fantillean.Cf2TAlo3.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=800 800w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fantillean.Cf2TAlo3.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=1400 1400w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fantillean.Cf2TAlo3.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=2000 2000w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fantillean.Cf2TAlo3.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=2600 2600w, https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fig.ft.com%2Fhaiti-gangs%2Fassets%2Fstatic%2Fantillean.Cf2TAlo3.jpg?source=ig&amp;quality=high&amp;width=3200 3200w" src="https://ig.ft.com/haiti-gangs/assets/static/antillean.Cf2TAlo3.jpg" alt="A large blue shipping container labeled &quot;Antillean&quot; is being moved by a yellow container handler in a freight yard.
